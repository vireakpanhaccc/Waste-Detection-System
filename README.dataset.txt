Here are a few use cases for this project:

1. **Smart Waste Segregation**: The "Waste" model can be deployed in waste management systems to facilitate automated sorting and segregation of waste into different categories. This technology could be particularly useful for recycling facilities to increase their efficiency.

2. **Educational Tools**: The model could be used to develop educational software or applications to teach about waste types and importance of recycling. Through the visualization of different waste types, users can learn how to properly sort waste in their daily lives.

3. **Environment Impact Studies**: Environmental researchers or NGOs can use this model to analyse and quantify waste in different environments, like cities, forests, or rivers, and quantify the types of human-derived waste polluting these areas. 

4. **Smart Trash Cans**: The model could be incorporated in smart trash cans or bins to analyze what kind of waste is being thrown away, helping to better understand waste patterns in specific neighborhoods or cities, and to enforce proper disposal of recyclable materials.

5. **Industrial Waste Management**: Industries producing large amounts of waste could apply this model to monitor and manage their waste production, ensuring appropriate disposal and tracking of waste materials.
